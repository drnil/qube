# QUantum computing for BEginners: <br>How To Program Your Own Quantum Computer Simulator

**Do you think you need to know quantum physics to understand how a quantum computer works? Nope, no worries there. You don't need a deep dive into physics or mathematics, just a bit of familiarity with vectors and matrix multiplication. That's really it. A good handle on Python programming and a few numpy functions will do the trick, specifically:** [**`reshape`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html), [**`kron`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.kron.html), [**`matmul`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html), [**`swapaxes`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.swapaxes.html), [**`linalg.norm`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html), **and** [**`random.choice`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.norm.html).
**In fact, twelve lines of Python code suffice to define a complete simulator.**

**The whole point of this project is to give you an informal, brief, hopefully digestible and educational description of *how you can easily implement your own quantum computer simulator*. It's *not* about 'Yet Another Quantum Computer Simulator', which are a dime a dozen, but about *how to build your own*. And, honestly, there's probably no better way to learn how a quantum computer works!**

The project contains annotated Python for the report [How to program your own quantum computer simulator or QUBE: QUantum computing for BEginners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06624) available on arXiv with URI [DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2312.06624](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2312.06624) or short URI [DOI:10/k8hd](https://doi.org/k8hd).

The code is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. It was developed using Python version 3.11.5 and PyTorch version 2.1.1.
